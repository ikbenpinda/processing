My Processing sketches.

This project expects a few additional steps to run:

1. Folder structure:

- assets
  - data
  - fonts
  - images
  - sounds
- p5
  - addons
  - p5.js

where p5 contains the same files as you'd get from the example file from the official website,
and where assets contains any custom fonts, sounds, you name it.

Be sure to add any necessary fonts or sounds, or check the config if some need to be changed.

Other than that, you should be good to go!
